# JiraUNA_TEST
Jira Unassigned user detection and deletion automation currently V1

!!!!!!THIS SCRIPT IS CURRENTLY UNTESTED YET!!!!

Remember to replace placeholders like https://your-jira-instance.atlassian.net, your-username, and your-password with your actual Jira instance URL, username, and password.

This script will find users who are part of the "unassigned" role, and if they also have roles role1, role2, and role3, it will remove the "unassigned" role from their profile.

Please test this script thoroughly in a controlled environment before using it in a production setting to ensure it behaves as expected.
